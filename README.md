This is the app for WATER PLANT PROJECT

We aim to develop a program to check the suitable time for watering plants.
This program is using raspberry pi which has each moisture, humidity and temperature sensor.
Raspberry pi will send information about their information to Server.
Server will update each plant's information periodically.
